    <h1>Welcome to Web Development</h1>
    <h2>Getting Started with HTML</h2>
    <p>HTML, or HyperText Markup Language, is the standard language for creating web pages. It allows you to structure content and create elements such as headings, paragraphs, links, and images.</p>

    <h2>Understanding CSS</h2>
    <p>CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, is used to control the presentation of web pages. With CSS, you can adjust colors, fonts, layouts, and more, enhancing the visual appeal of your website. Learning CSS alongside HTML is essential for any web developer.</p>
